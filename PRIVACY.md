# Privacy Policy

## Last Updated: May 17, 2025

## Introduction

localAI is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application collects, uses, and safeguards information when you use our mobile application.

## Summary

**localAI processes all data locally on your device.** The app does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal information or conversation data with external servers or third parties.

## Information Collection and Use

### Local Processing

- All AI inference occurs entirely on your device
- Conversations with the AI remain on your device and are never transmitted externally
- No user data is uploaded to remote servers
- No analytics or telemetry data is collected

### User-Added Models

When you import custom models:
- Model files are stored locally in your device's storage within the app's sandbox
- These files are never uploaded to external servers
- The app does not analyze the content of your model files beyond what's necessary for functionality

## Permissions

### File Access

localAI requests access to documents only when you explicitly choose to import custom models. We only access files you specifically select, and we do not scan or index any other files on your device.

## Data Security

Since all data is processed locally on your device, data security is maintained through your device's built-in security features. We recommend using a device password/PIN and keeping your iOS up to date.

## Privacy

localAI does not collect personal information from anyone.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on our GitHub repository. Significant changes will be communicated through app updates.

## Your Choices

You can delete conversations and imported models at any time through the app's interface. If you wish to remove all app data, you can uninstall the application.

## Contact Information

If you have questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please open an issue on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/sse-97/localAI.
